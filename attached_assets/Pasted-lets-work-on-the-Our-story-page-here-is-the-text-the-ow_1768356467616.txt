Food That Tells a Story
My culinary journey began in the vibrant kitchens of East Africa, from the age of Seven where I learned that the best meals aren't just made they're crafted with intention, patience, and love from my mother .
From bustling markets filled with cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, coriander and cloves to home kitchens where recipes passed through generations, I discovered that food is more than sustenance. It's connection. It's memory. It's how we show love when words aren't enough.
Today, I bring those traditions to Atlanta honoring East African flavors while sourcing locally and growing what I can in my own backyard.
When we say "from scratch," we mean it.
Everything Made from Scratch
Everything Made from Scratch
When we say from scratch, we mean it.
Every weekend, I grind xawaash the signature East African spice blend of cumin, coriander, cardamom and cinnamon by hand. This is the soul of our cooking, the warmth in every bite, the aroma that makes our kitchen smell like home.
Every dough is rolled fresh. Every sauce simmers for hours. Every spice blend is crafted in small batches to preserve its vibrant flavor. No shortcuts. No preservatives. Just whole ingredients and time.
Because you can taste the difference between food made with care and food made for convenience.
Distinctive and Bold
Here's what sets us apart: we know every farmer by name.
Our produce comes from Atlanta-area farms practicing sustainable agriculture. Our meats are pasture-raised and humanely treated. Our herbs? Many grow in our backyard garden and my husband's hydroponic system.
From soil to plate, we source with intention because knowing where your food comes from isn't a luxury. It's how food should be.
Our Backyard Farm
Behind our kitchen is a garden where we grow seasonal vegetables, heirloom tomatoes, and fresh herbs year-round. What you eat today was often picked this morning.
We grow what we can. What we can't grow, we source from farmers who share our values: no chemicals, no compromises, just real food grown right.
Why This Matters
Most caterers optimize for cost and speed. We optimize for quality and integrity.
That means:
We can't serve hundreds at rock-bottom prices
We can't cut corners when costs rise
We're not for everyone
But it also means:
Every dish tastes alive, vibrant, layered
You know exactly where your food comes from
You're supporting local farmers and sustainable practices
Your guests eat food made with intention, not convenience
If you care about what you eat and where it comes from, you're already part of us.
