SunveilCatering Website Enhancement Prompt
Overview
Enhance the existing SunveilCatering website with three major feature sets: (1) a fully functional Catering/Wholesale inquiry system with cart builder, (2) complete interactive e-commerce functionality with hyper-realistic product imagery, and (3) a unified Menu + Locations page that shows product availability by partner location.

Feature Set 1: Catering & Wholesale Page (/catering)
Purpose
Allow businesses, event planners, and bulk buyers to build a custom catering/wholesale inquiry cart and submit it as a lead/request form. This is NOT a checkout—it's a lead generation tool that sends inquiries to the Sunveil team.
